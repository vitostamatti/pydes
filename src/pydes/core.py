class Simulator:
    """
    `Simulator` is the central object of Py-DES and is used to model all the process and events of the system.

    Its main objective is to schedule process and events and then execute them in a time-ordered way.

    Args:
        initial_time: The initial simulation time specified as a float or datetime object.
        trace: Indicates whether tracing is enabled or not.

    Simulators can be instantiated either using numeric time (float or int) or datetime time.

    To create a `Simulator` with numeric time units simply ommit the argument or pass a specific
    `until` argument.
    ```python
    sim = Simulator(until=10)
    ```

    If you prefer to use datetime objects, you can pass to the until argument a `datetime` object.

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime
    sim = Simulator(until=datetime.max)
    ```

    Once you created the `Simulator` object you can start modeling your procesess using its differents methods.

    Methods:
        sleep: Sleep for the given duration.
        wait_for: Suspends the process until a condition becomes true.
        sleep_until: Sleep until the given simulation time.
        schedule: Activates a process either immediately (if both `at` and `after` are None) or after a delay.
        run: Starts simulation.
