# Examples

In this section you an find a handful of examples using `Py-DES` for modeling multiple scenarios of
different complexity.

The idea is not to showcase a full real world example, that could come soon in a separate code repository,
but to cover the usage of all the components and capabilities that `Py-DES` has to offer.
